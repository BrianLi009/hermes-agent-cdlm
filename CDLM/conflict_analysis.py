CDCL Conflict Analysis

This module implements conflict analysis for CDCL-style implication graphs.
Given a conflict node, it finds:
1. The learned clause (collection of node IDs)
2. The First Unique Implication Point (1-UIP)
3. The decision level to backjump to

IMPORTANT - Semantic Interpretation:
====================================
In SAT solving, literals in the trail are TRUE (assigned), and the learned
clause contains their NEGATIONS to prevent the conflict.

In this implementation:
- Node IDs in the implication graph represent POSITIVE assignments (what was assigned)
- Node IDs in the learned clause represent literals whose assignments CAUSED the conflict
- Semantically: "If these assignments are made together, conflict occurs"

For SAT encoding: The learned clause would be the NEGATION of these literals.
Example: If learned clause = {A, B}, the SAT clause is (NOT A OR NOT B)
